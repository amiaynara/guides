###1. `if else` pattern
```
def if_method():
  if condition == true:
    message = 'the condition was true'
  else:
    message = 'the condition was false'
  return message
```

Have a look at the below
```
def if_method():
  message = 'the condition was false'
  if condition == true:
    message = 'the condition was true'
  return message
```
**Note:** How we eliminated the `else` clause in the second code snippet.
