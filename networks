Computer Networks

Repeaters : They amplify, so that signal does not attinuate. They were first one to one.
Hub:    These are physical devices that,are dumb, and forward the traffic from one port to all
        other ports connected. 
Switches: These are devices that have intelligence. They forward from one MAC address to another
          that was intended. They fall under the second layer. [Data link layer]. They use table.
          They are used within a network[LAN or WAN]

Bridges: they fall somewhere in between. 

Routers: These connect from one network to another. IP addresses play an important part. 
Firewall: PC also have this. But they are software implemented. But you can purchase one that is 
        dedicated for this sole purpose. Also, these firewalls can be present in modern day routers.
        They are basically allowing only the traffic that has been specified by the user. 

Note: Internet ---> router ---> firewall---> switch ---> computers

IDS & IPS
Intrusion detection system and Intrusion protection system.

OSE and TCP/IP models
-----------------------
There are different models/blueprints that the "makers" adhere to inorder to standardise things
and division of labour. This has to several models since 1989. These two models are present to 
the network in layers.
        1. Application layer[layer 7]
        2. Transport layer
        3. Network layer/ Internet layer
        4. Data link
        5. Physical
currently we have a hybrid of these two models.
