This is a guide for REACT & REDUX
__________________________________

Why do we need a Library/Frameworks?
WE can build fairly complex websites using HTML, CSS, JS,bootstrap and jQuery. 
Complexity of managing DOM manipulation and data updates manually.
Well defined application architectures(these libraries and Frameworks have). 

A Library offers 
    - Collection of implementations of behaviour with a well defined interface to invoke it. 
    - Reuse of behaviour
    - Modularity (jquery)
Software Framework
    -Abstractionin which software provides generic functionality that can be selectively changed by additional 
     user-written code. 

 eg. Angular, Ember, Backbone....

What is React?
A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is Declarative and Component-based. Facebook developed in 2011. 
Speed. Simplicity. 

Vocabulary: One-way data flow, JSX, Components, State, Props, Virtual DOM, Element, Flux/Redux, Test.

-----------------
create-react-app
-----------------
We will be using yarn here. 
    sudo npm install --save-dev create-react-app
#install yarn exactly as given in the official documentation
    npx create-react-app <name_of_proj_directory> # after going into the intended directory
now install the lite-server(or any server)--> add that to the script of the package.json. 
    directory will be successfully created. And you will see the messages:
      yarn start
      yarn build
      yarn test
      yarn eject
    These options will be shown.
    You will also see 6 files(folders are file in disguise).
now
    yarn start #npm start ## depending on your choice
This will open your default browser and with that you will see the animation React(yes the famous one).
